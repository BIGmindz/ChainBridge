# Archive Directory - Inert Code
# This directory contains archived legacy code that is NOT part of ChainBridge.
#
# Purpose of this .gitignore:
# - Prevent tooling (IDEs, linters, test runners) from auto-discovering these files
# - Signal to developers that this directory is intentionally excluded
#
# The files ARE tracked in git for historical purposes, but should not be:
# - Imported
# - Executed
# - Linted
# - Tested
#
# See: archive/ARCHIVE_CONTRACT.md

# Prevent Python package discovery
