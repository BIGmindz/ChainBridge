# PAC-SEC-P818: Post-Quantum Cryptography Requirements
# ML-DSA-65 (FIPS 204) Digital Signatures
#
# Updated: 2026-01-16
# Environment: Python 3.11+, cryptography==46.0.1 compatible
# Status: TESTED AND APPROVED

# Primary PQC Library - Dilithium3 (ML-DSA-65 equivalent)
dilithium-py==1.4.0

# Note: dilithium-py provides:
# - Dilithium2 (Security Level 2, ~ML-DSA-44 equivalent)
# - Dilithium3 (Security Level 3, ~ML-DSA-65 equivalent) ← TARGET
# - Dilithium5 (Security Level 5, ~ML-DSA-87 equivalent)
#
# NOTE: dilithium-py implements the pre-FIPS 204 Dilithium scheme.
# Key/signature sizes differ slightly from final FIPS 204 ML-DSA standard:
# - Public key: 1952 bytes (same)
# - Secret key: 4000 bytes (vs 4032 in FIPS 204)
# - Signature: 3293 bytes (vs 3309 in FIPS 204)

# Dependencies (auto-installed)
# No additional dependencies required beyond Python stdlib

# PREVIOUSLY EVALUATED (not used):
# pqcrypto==0.3.4  # Replaced with dilithium-py for active maintenance
# liboqs-python    # Requires native liboqs library
# oqs              # Wrong package (query language)
