# New Listings Radar Module

## Overview

New Listings Radar is a specialized module for the Multiple-signal-decision-bot that monitors major cryptocurrency exchanges for new coin listings and generates trading signals based on listing announcements. The module leverages the "new listing effect" - a market phenomenon where newly listed coins often experience significant price movement in the short term.

## Features

- **Multi-Exchange Monitoring**: Tracks new listings across Kraken, Coinbase, Binance, OKX, and KuCoin

- **Announcement Scraping**: Parses exchange blogs and announcement pages for upcoming listings

- **Risk Filtering**: Applies customizable risk criteria to filter potential opportunities

- **Signal Generation**: Creates standardized trading signals that integrate with the bot's decision engine

- **Performance Backtesting**: Tests the strategy against historical listing data

- **Visual Dashboard**: Provides visualization of listing opportunities and performance metrics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+

- Required Python packages (automatically installed by `setup_new_listings.py`):

  - beautifulsoup4

  - ccxt

  - aiohttp

  - pandas

  - numpy

  - matplotlib

  - seaborn

  - requests

### Installation

1. Set up the dependencies:

   ```bash

   python setup_new_listings.py

   ```

1. Verify installation:

   ```bash

   pip list | grep -E "(beautifulsoup4|ccxt|aiohttp)"

   ```

### Running Independently

The New Listings Radar can be run independently from the main bot for testing or standalone operation:

```bash

## Scan exchanges for new listings

python run_new_listings_radar.py --scan

## Run a backtest over 30 days

python run_new_listings_radar.py --backtest --days 30

## Scan and save results to a file

python run_new_listings_radar.py --scan --save --output my_signals.json

## Run the dashboard visualization

python new_listings_dashboard.py

```text

### Integration with Main Bot

The module is already integrated with the main Multiple-signal-decision-bot system:

```python

## The multi_signal_bot.py already includes code to initialize and use the module

from modules.new_listings_radar_module import NewListingsRadar

## Initialize radar

radar = NewListingsRadar()

## Get signals from radar (called within the bot's main signal processing loop)

radar_signals = await radar.execute_listing_strategy()

```text

## Configuration

The module uses configuration settings from `config/trading_config.json` with these key parameters:

- `exchanges`: List of exchanges to monitor

- `min_market_cap`: Minimum market cap for considered assets

- `min_volume`: Minimum 24h trading volume

- `signal_strength_threshold`: Minimum score to generate a signal

- `max_days_since_announcement`: Maximum days since listing announcement

## Signal Output Format

Signals generated by the module follow this structure:

```json

{
  "source": "new_listings_radar",
  "symbol": "ETH/USD",
  "exchange": "coinbase",
  "action": "BUY",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "timestamp": "2023-07-15T14:30:00",
  "metadata": {
    "listing_date": "2023-07-15T14:00:00",
    "announcement_date": "2023-07-10T09:15:00",
    "announcement_url": "https://blog.coinbase.com/...",
    "market_cap": 5000000,
    "volume_24h": 1200000,
    "risk_score": 65
  }
}

```text

## Dashboard

The New Listings Radar includes a visualization dashboard that provides:

- Active listing opportunities

- Historical performance metrics

- Risk assessment visualization

- Exchange-specific statistics

Run the dashboard with:

```bash

python new_listings_dashboard.py

```text

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

- **Network Errors**: Ensure proper internet connection as the module requires API access to exchanges

- **Rate Limiting**: The module implements rate-limiting safeguards, but exchange-side limits may still occur

- **Missing Dependencies**: Run `setup_new_listings.py` to install or update dependencies

- **Parsing Errors**: Exchange format changes may cause announcement parsing issues; check logs
