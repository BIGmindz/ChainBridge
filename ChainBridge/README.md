# ChainBridge — Sense. Think. Act.

**ChainBridge** is a logistics & financial OS for **tokenized supply chains**.

We help shippers, brokers, carriers, and financiers:

- **Sense** what’s happening in the network (loads, lanes, assets, risk).
- **Think** with AI-driven risk, performance, and credit scoring.
- **Act** automatically through programmable payments and tokenized incentives.

## What ChainBridge Does

Supply chains today live in **permanent volatility**.
ChainBridge connects **real-world events**, **AI decisions**, and **money movement** in one loop:

> **Sense. Think. Act.**
> From shipment to payment to proof — in one OS.

### Sense

Capture ground truth across the network.

- **ChainSense** — IoT, telematics, EDI, TMS/WMS/ERP, and external feeds (ports, macro indexes).
- **ChainBoard – The OC** — Operator Console for a 360° view of shipments, risk, and cash.
- Canonical shipment + event model with unified IDs for freight, counterparties, and contracts.

### Think

Turn noisy signals into decisions.

- **ChainIQ** — AI/rules engine for:
  - Shipment & lane risk scoring
  - Counterparty reliability
  - Terms / creditworthiness
  - Fraud & anomaly detection
- Focus on **glass-box models** with clear inputs, scores, and explanations.

### Act

Wire decisions into money and workflows.

- **ChainPay** — programmable payments for logistics:
  - Milestone-based payouts (e.g. _20% pickup / 70% delivery / 10% claim window_)
  - Dynamic terms driven by **ChainIQ risk_score**
- **CB-USDx** (design target) — ChainBridge settlement token:
  - Bridges traditional invoices with on-chain proofs
  - Ready for XRPL settlement and Chainlink-based actuation

## Why ChainBridge?

Traditional tools stop at **visibility**.
ChainBridge goes further:

- Connects **real-time data** to **explainable decisions**
- Connects those decisions directly to **cash, terms, and incentives**
- Keeps everything **auditable and ready for on-chain proof**

If you operate or finance freight, ChainBridge is built to:

- Reduce working capital friction
- Reward reliable performance automatically
- Create a single, provable source of truth across shipments, risk, and money
