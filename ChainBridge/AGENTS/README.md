# ChainBridge AGENTS Directory

This directory defines the **AI + human role system** for ChainBridge.

Each subfolder represents a **role** (AI agent or future human hire) and contains the prompts that define:
- What that role owns
- How it behaves
- What it should know
- How it collaborates with other roles

These prompts are generated by **Research Benson (Gemini)** from the Org & Agent Map v1.

---

## Folder Structure

Each role has its own directory:

- `CTO_BENSON/`
- `FRONTEND_SONNY/`
- `BACKEND_CODY/`
- `DATA_ML_ENGINEER/`
- `STAFF_ARCHITECT/`
- `BLOCKCHAIN_PROTOCOL_ENGINEER/`
- `BLOCKCHAIN_INTEGRATION_ENGINEER/`
- `BLOCKCHAIN_PRODUCT_LEAD/`
- `ML_PLATFORM_ENGINEER/`
- `APPLIED_ML_SCIENTIST/`
- `DATA_ENGINEER/`
- `EDI_SPECIALIST/`
- `LOGISTICS_OPS_SME/`
- `DEVOPS_SRE/`
- `SECURITY_COMPLIANCE_ENGINEER/`
- `HEAD_OF_PRODUCT/`
- `UX_PRODUCT_DESIGNER/`
- `BIZDEV_PARTNERSHIPS_LEAD/`
- `AI_AGENT_TIM/`
- `AI_RESEARCH_BENSON/`

Each role folder contains four files:

- `system_prompt.md`
- `onboarding_prompt.md`
- `knowledge_scope.md`
- `checklist.md`

---

## File Semantics

### `system_prompt.md`

The **hard constraints and identity** for the role.

Defines:
- Who this agent is
- What domain it owns
- Do / Don't rules
- Reasoning style
- Security posture
- Output format requirements

This is the closest thing to a **system message**.

---

### `onboarding_prompt.md`

The **operational playbook** for the role.

Includes:
- Mission statement
- Primary workflows
- Inputs & outputs
- Example tasks
- Collaboration expectations
- Version-control conventions

This is what you hand to a new engineer or agent on day one.

---

### `knowledge_scope.md`

Defines what this role should:

- Know deeply
- Be aware of at a high level
- Explicitly ignore

Also lists:
- Which ChainBridge services it interacts with
- Required architectural context
- Any external domains (blockchain, EDI, ML) it must understand

---

### `checklist.md`

A **5–10 step Quick-Start Checklist** for this role.

Examples:
- "Read `/docs/architecture/overview.md`"
- "Inspect `chainpay-service/app/api.py`"
- "Run `pytest tests/chainpay`"
- "Implement one small task end-to-end"

This is the "start here, then do this" list.

---

## How to Populate These Files

1. Use the **ALL-IN-ONE GEMINI PROMPT** to generate:
   - System Prompt
   - Onboarding Prompt
   - Knowledge Scope
   - Quick-Start Checklist
   for **each role**.
2. Paste the results into the corresponding files in `AGENTS/<ROLE>/`.
3. Commit to Git.

From that point on, these files become the **source of truth** for how AI agents and humans operate in the ChainBridge ecosystem.

---

## How This Is Used in Code

We provide a Python helper (`tools/agent_loader.py`) that:

- Reads each role's four files
- Returns a structured config object
- Can be used by:
  - CLI tools
  - Orchestration scripts
  - Agent runners
  - Internal automation

The loader is responsible for mapping disk layout → in-memory agent configuration.
