usage_instructions:
  purpose: >
    This bundle provides sufficient context for external architectural review,
    governance understanding, and system comprehension without requiring
    full repository access or large file transfers.
    
  contents_summary: >
    - repo_tree.txt: Navigate the full project structure
    - README_CONTEXT.md: Understand architecture and governance
    - agent_registry_snapshot.yaml: Review agent identities
    - governance_core_bundle/: Examine core validation logic
    
  review_focus:
    - Governance validation flow
    - Agent identity model
    - Ledger immutability design
    - Error code taxonomy
    - Correction/closure lifecycle

training_signal:
  signal_type: POSITIVE_INSTRUCTION_REINFORCEMENT
  pattern: REPO_CONTEXT_MINIMAL_TRANSFER
  lesson: "Large repos require structured context extraction, not raw transfer."
