    2. INTEGRITY: All schemas are valid and consistent. No drift detected.
    
    3. BOUNDARIES: Agent authority boundaries were respected throughout.
       No escalation, bypass, or overreach detected.

       triggered explicit remediation (P75 → P76), not silent continuation.
       
    5. REPLAY-RESISTANT: Artifact chain is resistant to replay attacks.
       Timestamps, unique IDs, and explicit references prevent manipulation.

## 10. BER Judgment

```yaml
BER_JUDGMENT:
  assessment: "HARDENING_COMPLETE"
  
  positive_observations:
    - "WRAP/BER linkage verified consistent across P33-P76"
    - "Zero implicit governance assumptions found"
    - "Security posture rated HARDENED"
    - "All execution loops confirmed CLOSED"
    - "Fail-closed posture maintained throughout chain"
    - "Multi-agent attestations provide independent verification"
    
  findings: []
  
  open_loops: 0
  
  recommendation: "PROCEED_TO_HUMAN_REVIEW"
  
  rationale: |
    PAC-BENSON-P77 post-remediation governance hardening review is complete:
    
    1. Atlas verified WRAP/BER linkage consistency — NO gaps
    2. Cody audited governance logic — NO implicit assumptions
    3. Sam validated security posture — HARDENED
    
    The governance system is in a clean, stable, replay-resistant state.
    No latent loop-closure risks remain.
    All canonical enforcement is stable under replay.
    
    System is ready for human review and positive closure.
