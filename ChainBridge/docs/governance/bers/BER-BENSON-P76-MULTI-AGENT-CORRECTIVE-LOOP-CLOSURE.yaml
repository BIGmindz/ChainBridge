## 10. BER Judgment

```yaml
BER_JUDGMENT:
  assessment: "FULL_PASS"
  
  positive_observations:
    - "Atlas WRAP emitted and schema-compliant"
    - "Atlas execution loop now CLOSED"
    - "Cody attestation confirms no additional work needed"
    - "Sam security review confirms no exposure"
    - "All PAC-BENSON-P76 tasks completed"
    - "Multi-agent coordination successful"
    
  pending_items: []
  
  recommendation: "PROCEED_TO_HUMAN_REVIEW"
  
  rationale: |
    PAC-BENSON-P76 has been fully executed:
    
    1. Atlas emitted the missing WRAP (T1)
    2. Benson acknowledged receipt (T2)
    3. This BER closes the Atlas loop (T3)
    4. Cody attested no additional work (T4)
    5. Sam validated governance and security posture (T5)
    
    All execution loops are now CLOSED.
    No blocking issues remain.
