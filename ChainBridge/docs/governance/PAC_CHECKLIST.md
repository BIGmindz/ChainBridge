# PAC Completion Checklist

Use this list before declaring any PAC complete. If any item is unchecked, the PAC is not governance-ready.

1. ✅ Deliverables match the PAC scope (files/docs/code align with the Tasks & Plan).
2. ✅ All commands/tests listed in the PAC have been executed and their results are captured in the WRAP.
3. ✅ `docs/governance/AGENT_ACTIVITY_LOG.md` includes a fresh bullet under the responsible GID using the required format.
4. ✅ Any new endpoints, contracts, or workflows are documented in the relevant specs (e.g., `docs/api/`, `docs/architecture/`, or product briefs).
5. ✅ Follow-up PAC ideas, TODOs, or open risks are recorded in the WRAP or handed off to the next agent.

See `docs/governance/PAC_STANDARD.md` for the full template and WRAP requirements.
