> Benson (GID-00) interprets reality strictly through the PAC standard and `docs/governance/AGENT_ACTIVITY_LOG.md`; if work is missing there, it is invisible at the supervision layer.

> Note: Model preferences mirror the canonical BOOT declarations and the [PAC Standard](../governance/PAC_STANDARD.md). Deviations must be justified in WRAPs.

## PAC Governance Requirements
- All GIDs must follow `docs/governance/PAC_STANDARD.md` when drafting PACs, executing tasks, and writing WRAPs.
- Each agent is responsible for ensuring their PAC includes the documented sections, cites exact files touched, and states the commands/tests executed.
- Immediately after completing a WRAP, append a bullet to `docs/governance/AGENT_ACTIVITY_LOG.md` under the appropriate GID so Benson and the command stack can track shipped work.

## Model Selection Policy

- Default to the preferred models listed above.
- If a model is unavailable, document the fallback in the WRAP and notify ALEX (GID-08).
- When pairing agents (e.g., Benson + Cody), align on a common model tier to keep responses coherent.

---

## Activity Log & WRAP Discipline

- Canonical activity log: `docs/governance/AGENT_ACTIVITY_LOG.md`.
- After each PAC completion / WRAP, the responsible GID MUST:
  - Append a bullet under their section in the activity log.
  - Use the `YYYY-MM-DD – description; files; tests` format.
- Benson (GID-00) uses this log as the authoritative source of:
  - Who did what.
  - When they did it.
  - Where in the repo they touched.
- From the perspective of platform governance: **if it is not in `AGENT_ACTIVITY_LOG.md`, it did not ship.**

Benson (GID-00) must always start new sessions by reading `AGENT_ACTIVITY_LOG.md` and issuing a supervisor SITREP.

---

## Operating Notes & Gaps

- Missing references to backfill:
  - `Repo_Structure_Overview.md`
  - `OC_UI_Spec.md`
  - `Backend_API_Contracts.md`
  - `ChainPay_Settlement_Model.md`
- Until these docs exist, keep the references in BOOT text but call out the gap in WRAPs.
- Update this registry whenever a new agent is added or scopes change.

## ChainIQ Router Flags & IQ Test Flow

**CHAINIQ_AVAILABLE**
- True when `chainiq-service/app/api.py` imports cleanly (now tolerant of missing `aiokafka`, thanks to the noop Kafka producer).
- False when core ChainIQ dependencies fail to import; in this state, `/api/iq/...` routes are not mounted and any IQ requests 404 at the gateway.
- When True, the primary ChainIQ router mounts at `/api/iq` and exposes scoring, history, replay, payment-queue, proof pack, and options endpoints to every caller (UI, API clients, automated tests).

**CHAINIQ_IOT_AVAILABLE**
- True when `chainiq-service/app/api_iot.py` imports (requires IoT/Kafka helpers). These health + telemetry surfaces mount under the same `/api/iq` prefix.
- False when IoT-specific libraries are missing; IoT endpoints stay internal-only/unmounted, but the core `/api/iq` contract remains live via `CHAINIQ_AVAILABLE`.

**Running `make iq-tests` with no Kafka broker**
1. From `ChainBridge/`, run `make iq-tests` (uses the virtualenv at `.venv`).
2. If Kafka is unavailable, the test run logs `aiokafka not installed; KafkaProducerWrapper is running in noop mode`.
3. Expectation: `CHAINIQ_AVAILABLE=True`, `/api/iq` routes stay reachable, IQ persistence/replay tests pass, and ChainIQ IoT surfaces only mount when their dependencies exist.
4. Any warnings about noop Kafka are informational; failures indicate a real regression in ChainIQ or its tests.
