# 🎯 ChainBridge Project Documentation – Master Index
**Created:** November 19, 2025
**Status:** M01 ✅ Complete | M02 🔥 Ready to Launch | M03 ⬜ Blocked
**Total Documentation:** 1,910 lines across 6 files

---

> Docs have been organized under `docs/product/` (milestones/playbooks) and `docs/ops/` (operator/runbooks). Paths below refer to those locations; e.g., `docs/product/PROJECT_STATUS_SUMMARY.md`.

## Developer Ground Rules

- Architecture docs → `docs/architecture/`
- Product / milestones / status → `docs/product/`
- Ops / runbooks → `docs/ops/`
- Canonical agents → `AGENTS 2/`
- Legacy / non-ChainBridge experiments → `legacy/`

If you add a new top-level directory, update: `docs/architecture/REPO_STRUCTURE.md`.
