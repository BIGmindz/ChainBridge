## About This Repository

This repository is for a machine learning project that aims to create a scalable, uncorrelated signal decision-maker. The bot will use multiple signals to make decisions. The primary programming language is Python.

## How to Contribute

As a new developer, I'm relying on GitHub Copilot to help me structure and build this project. When contributing, please follow these guidelines:

1.  **Code Structure:**
    *   All source code should be placed in a `src/` directory.
    *   Data-related scripts should be in `src/data/`.
    *   Machine learning models should be in `src/models/`.
    *   The main application logic should be in `src/main.py`.
    *   Tests should be written in the `tests/` directory.

2.  **Code Style:**
    *   Please follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python.
    *   Include docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions.
    *   Add comments to explain complex logic.

3.  **Pull Requests:**
    *   Before creating a pull request, please make sure the code is well-tested.
    *   The pull request description should clearly explain the changes and the problem they solve.

## Project Goals

The main goal is to develop a robust machine learning bot that can:
- Ingest multiple data signals.
- Process and analyze these signals.
- Make decisions based on machine learning models.
- Be scalable and produce uncorrelated signals.

When you generate code, please keep these goals in mind. For example, suggest scalable solutions and robust error handling.
