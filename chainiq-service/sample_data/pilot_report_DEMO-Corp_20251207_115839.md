# ChainIQ Retrospective Pilot Report

**Tenant:** DEMO-Corp
**Generated:** 2025-12-07 16:58 UTC
**Model Version:** chainiq-v0.1-heuristic

---

## Overview

We analyzed **50** historical shipments to evaluate how ChainIQ's risk scoring would have performed on your freight network.

- **Bad Events Found:** 12 shipments (24.0% of total)
- **Total Realized Loss:** $304,050

---

## Key Metrics

### Model Discrimination (AUC-ROC): **0.50**

This indicates **limited** ability to distinguish high-risk from low-risk shipments. (0.5 = random guessing, 1.0 = perfect prediction)

### Risk Concentration (Lift @ Top 10%): **1.0x**

The top 10% highest-risk shipments have **1.0x** the bad-event rate of the overall population. This means ChainIQ effectively concentrates risk.

### Bad Event Capture Rate: **100%**

By focusing on just the top 10% of risk-scored shipments, we would have caught **100%** of all bad events before they happened.

### Hypothetical Savings: **$152,025**

If we had intervened on the top 10% highest-risk shipments that eventually had bad outcomes, we estimate approximately **$152,025** in losses could have been avoided or mitigated.

## Risk Score Distribution

| Risk Tier | Shipments | Interpretation |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| 0-30 (Low) | 0 | Safe to auto-approve |
| 30-60 (Medium) | 50 | Standard processing |
| 60-80 (High) | 0 | Tighten terms |
| 80-100 (Critical) | 0 | Hold/Escalate |

## Recommended Actions Distribution

| Decision | Count |
|----------|-------|
| APPROVE | 50 |
| TIGHTEN_TERMS | 0 |
| HOLD | 0 |
| ESCALATE | 0 |

## Model Performance at Threshold 60

| | Predicted Bad | Predicted Good |
|---|--------------|----------------|
| **Actually Bad** | 0 (TP) | 12 (FN) |
| **Actually Good** | 0 (FP) | 38 (TN) |

- **Precision:** 0.0% (of flagged shipments, how many were actually bad)
- **Recall:** 0.0% (of bad shipments, how many did we catch)

## What This Means for You

✅ **Targeted intervention is viable.** By focusing operator attention on just 10% of shipments, you could address 100% of problems.

✅ **Real dollar impact.** Estimated $152,025 in avoidable losses identified in this historical period alone.
