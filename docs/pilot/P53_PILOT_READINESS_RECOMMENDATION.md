## 8. Recommendation

### 8.1 Primary Recommendation

**PROCEED TO PAC-JEFFREY-P54 (Monetization & Pricing Gates)**

Rationale:
- All P53 gates passed
- External pilot validated core assumptions
- No systemic issues identified
- Legal boundaries proven effective
- Security posture confirmed

### 8.2 Alternative Options

| Option | Recommendation | Rationale |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Expand pilot | ✅ RECOMMENDED | Ready for more partners |
| Hold | ⚪ OPTIONAL | If resource-constrained |
| Scale back | ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED | No evidence supports |

---

## 9. Training Signals (P53)

| Signal | Insight |
|--------|---------|
| TS-P53-PILOT-001 | External pilots expose integration reality |
| TS-P53-PILOT-002 | Trust fails at boundaries first |
| TS-P53-PILOT-003 | Legal enforcement must precede scale |
| TS-P53-PILOT-004 | Pre-emptive blocking prevents violations |
| TS-P53-PILOT-005 | UX clarity reduces support burden |
