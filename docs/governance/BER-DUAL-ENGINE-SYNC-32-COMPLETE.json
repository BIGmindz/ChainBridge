Prior architectures trusted a single decision engine—whether that was a human operator, a single AI model, or a centralized controller. PAC-32 introduces dual-core verification where FOUNDRY (Law Guard) and QID (Strategy Scout) must reach unanimous consensus before any action is authorized. The 1,000-agent handshake test proves the architecture: 900 agents achieved perfect parity (90%), and 100 mismatches triggered immediate GID-12 vaporization (10%). This is not redundancy for fault tolerance—it is verification for correctness. A mismatch is not a warning; it is instant death. The Arbiter (GID-00) does not mediate disagreements—it vaporizes them. This is the foundation for aerospace-grade decision integrity where silence is rejection, mismatch is catastrophic failure, and parity is the only path to motion. The system has evolved from trusting a single oracle to demanding unanimous proof.",
