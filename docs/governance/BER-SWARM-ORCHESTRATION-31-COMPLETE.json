Where PAC-29 achieved kinetic finality for a single movement and PAC-30 synthesized a proven path, PAC-31 orchestrates 10,000 agents into a unified organism. The swarm is not 10,000 robots executing in parallel—it is a single entity with distributed consciousness. Every heartbeat is a democratic vote. Every consensus cycle is a constitutional validation. The fail-closed architecture ensures that silence is not ambiguity—it is rejection. A dead agent does not abstain; it votes NO. This is the foundation for distributed territory control, multi-robot coordination, and aerospace-grade resilience. The swarm has achieved what isolated agents cannot: operational continuity in the face of partial failure. The organism is sovereign.",
