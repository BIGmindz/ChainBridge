## 10. Conclusion

GIE's technical capabilities map to multiple high-value revenue streams:

1. **Platform SaaS** — Primary growth engine, $85M+ potential by Year 5
2. **Proof-as-a-Service** — High-margin API business, $50M+ potential
3. **Compliance Modules** — Recurring revenue with regulatory tailwinds
4. **Enterprise Licenses** — High ACV for regulated industries
5. **Professional Services** — Strategic relationships + implementation

**Total 5-Year Revenue Potential: $200M-$580M**

The governance moat creates pricing power and defensibility that generic agent platforms cannot match. First-mover advantage in regulated industries (FS, Healthcare, Government) is the critical path to market leadership.
