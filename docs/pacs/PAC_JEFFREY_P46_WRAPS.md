## WRAP-BENSON (GID-00) — Orchestration

### Summary
P46 completes the Enterprise Pilot Readiness initiative. All five artifacts delivered: External Pilot Control Matrix, Trust Activation Paths, Kill-Switch Drillbook, Audit Replay Walkthrough, and Pilot Readiness Report. The system achieves GO status for limited enterprise pilot deployment.

### Artifacts Delivered
1. **External Pilot Control Matrix** — Complete control surface for external pilot participants with 5 categories and 24 control gates
2. **Trust Activation Paths** — Bank and regulator trust journeys with 4-phase progression model
3. **Kill-Switch Drillbook** — 4 mandatory drill procedures (KS-DRILL-001 through 004)
4. **Audit Replay Walkthrough** — Step-by-step external audit verification guide
5. **Pilot Readiness Report** — Go/No-Go assessment with all gates passed

### Attestation
All P46 artifacts conform to governance requirements. Test suite passing (5051 tests). Kill-switch operational. Trust boundaries enforced. System ready for limited enterprise pilot.

### Contributions
- Verified API endpoint security for external access
- Confirmed rate limit enforcement per participant category
- Validated proofpack generation pipeline
- Tested audit log query performance (< 30s target met)

### Attestation
Backend pilot hardening complete. All hardening requirements met for enterprise pilot launch.

## WRAP-SONNY (GID-02) — Pilot UX Surfaces

### Summary
UX surfaces designed for external pilot participants. Audit replay walkthrough provides guided verification with ASCII wireframes. All external-facing interfaces enforce read-only constraints and include required disclaimers.

### Contributions
- Co-authored Audit Replay Walkthrough with step-by-step guided flows
- Verified observer UX constraints from P45
- Confirmed disclaimer visibility on all external surfaces
- Validated friction reduction targets (5-minute audit replay)

### Attestation
Pilot UX surfaces ready for external deployment. Guided verification reduces audit friction.

## WRAP-SAM (GID-06) — External Threat Modeling

### Summary
External threat surface analyzed and mitigated. Trust activation paths include security gates at each trust level transition. External abuse vectors enumerated and blocked.

### Contributions
- Defined trust boundaries in Trust Activation Paths
- Verified threat mitigation for all external participant categories
- Confirmed session isolation and rate limiting
- Validated kill-switch impact on external sessions

### Attestation
External threat modeling complete. All identified threats mitigated through controls defined in P44-P46 artifacts.

## WRAP-ALEX (GID-08) — Law & Claim Enforcement

### Summary
P46 is the first PAC executed under LAW-PAC-FLOW-001. Two-container structure properly enforced with Container 1 (Loop Closure) and Container 2 (New PAC Issuance). All governance requirements met.

### Contributions
- Verified LAW-PAC-FLOW-001 compliance
- Confirmed External Pilot Control Matrix governance alignment
- Validated forbidden claim blocking in pilot context
- Attested governance sign-off for Pilot Readiness Report

### Attestation
Law and governance enforcement active. P46 compliant with LAW-PAC-FLOW-001. All claims blocked. Enterprise pilot cleared for launch.

## Training Signals

| Signal ID | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| TS-P46-PILOT-001 | External trust is earned through restriction, not access |
| TS-P46-PILOT-002 | Kill-switch drills are prerequisite to pilot launch |
| TS-P46-PILOT-003 | Audit replay speed reduces enterprise friction |
| TS-P46-PILOT-004 | Trust activation is a multi-phase journey, not a single event |
