Okay, let's initialize ChainBridge and establish a baseline status report.

1. **Factual State**

   - System: ChainBridge Constitutional Control Plane
   - Version: v0.0.1 (Genesis)
   - Status: Initializing. No PACs executed. Agent Registry online. No active incidents.

2. **Constitutional Analysis**

   - PDO: No previous operations to analyze.
   - Policy: Adhering to initial ChainDocs governance policies. All actions must align with the principle of "fail-closed" and require deterministic proof.
   - Governance: The system is currently in a permissive state, allowing for initial configuration and bootstrapping.

3. **Gaps & Risks**

   - Gaps: No PACs have been executed, meaning the system lacks configured policies, kill switches, and specific operational rules.
   - Risks: The permissive initial state presents a risk of misconfiguration or unauthorized actions. High dependency on successful execution of initial PACs.

4. **Authorized Next PAC Types**

   - **Priority 1: PAC-001: Bootstrap Configuration.** This PAC will configure core system parameters, establish initial policies, and activate essential kill switches.
   - **Priority 2: PAC-002: Agent Authorization.** This PAC will define the permissions and roles for each agent in the ChainBridge Agent Registry.
   - **Priority 3: PAC-003: Audit Log Initialization.** This PAC will set up the audit logging system to record all actions and decisions within ChainBridge.

5. **Forbidden Actions**

   - Direct modification of the Agent Registry outside of a formal PAC execution.
   - Execution of any task without a corresponding PAC.
   - Disabling the "fail-closed" default state.

6. **Project Roadmap**

   - Phase: Initialization & Bootstrapping
   - Next Milestones:
     - Execute PAC-001 (Bootstrap Configuration).
     - Execute PAC-002 (Agent Authorization).
     - Establish basic monitoring and alerting.

7. **Recommended Next Step**

   - Issue Work Order: Create `PAC-001: Bootstrap Configuration`. This PAC should establish basic policies, define critical parameters, and activate kill switches. Assign to BENSON (GID-00) for orchestration. The PAC must include a BER (Benefit, Effort, Risk) analysis prior to execution.
