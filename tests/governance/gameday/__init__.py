🔴 GOVERNANCE GAMEDAY TESTS — PAC-GOV-GAMEDAY-01

Adversarial failure simulation tests to prove governance controls
hold under attack conditions.

These tests prove:
1. Operations are denied when they should be
2. No state mutation occurs during failures
3. Telemetry events are emitted
4. audit_ref is preserved for traceability
