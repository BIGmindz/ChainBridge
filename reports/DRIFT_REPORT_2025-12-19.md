## Remediation Requirements

Per PAC-BENSON-ATLAS-GOVERNANCE-HARDENING-01:
- DO NOT auto-correct these violations
- This report becomes INPUT for future correction PACs
- Each file requires explicit assignment to an executing agent
- Correction PACs must be issued by appropriate lane owners

---

## Next Steps

1. **CODY (GID-01)** — Issue PAC to correct `core/`, `gateway/`, `api/` files
2. **MAGGIE (GID-10)** — Issue PAC to correct `ChainBridge/chainiq-service/` files
3. **ALEX (GID-08)** — Issue PAC to correct `tests/governance/` files
4. **ATLAS (GID-11)** — Issue PAC to correct `scripts/`, `tools/` files
